# NB10 AI-CAC Tool - Version 1.1.4 Release Notes

**Release Date**: 2025-10-17
**Type**: Critical Bug Fix Release

## üêõ Critical Bug Fixes

### Fixed: Program Hanging on Last Patient Case

**Issue**: When processing multiple patients (e.g., 5 cases in pilot mode), the program would hang indefinitely after completing the last patient, appearing stuck at "Running AI analysis..." with no error message.

**Root Cause**: DataLoader with `num_workers > 0` failed to properly terminate worker processes after the last iteration, causing the main process to wait indefinitely for worker cleanup.

**Solution**:
- Forced `num_workers = 0` for single-patient inference (no performance impact as each patient is processed sequentially)
- Added explicit DataLoader cleanup in try-finally block to ensure proper resource release
- Modified code locations:
  - `core/ai_cac_inference_lib.py` lines 249-255: Force num_workers=0
  - `core/ai_cac_inference_lib.py` lines 290-372: Add try-finally cleanup

**Verification**:
- ‚úÖ Tested with 5 consecutive cases on GPU (RTX 2060)
- ‚úÖ All cases completed successfully in 69.4s (avg 13.9s/case)
- ‚úÖ No hanging on last case
- ‚úÖ Program exits normally

## üîß Minor Fixes

### Updated PyDicom API Call

**Issue**: `pydicom.read_file()` is deprecated and will be removed in future versions, causing warnings.

**Solution**: Updated to use `pydicom.dcmread()` (modern API)
- Modified `core/processing.py` line 16

## üöÄ Upgrade Instructions

### For Existing Users:

1. **Backup your current installation** (optional but recommended)

2. **Replace the following files** with v1.1.4 versions:
   - `cli/run_nb10.py`
   - `core/ai_cac_inference_lib.py`
   - `core/processing.py`

3. **No configuration changes needed** - Your existing `config.yaml` will work as-is

4. **Resume feature compatibility** - Existing `.nb10_resume_cache.csv` files are fully compatible

### For New Users:

Follow the standard installation instructions in `README.md` or `docs/INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md`

## üîç Technical Details

### What Changed Internally

**Before (v1.1.3)**:
- DataLoader used `num_workers` from performance profile (could be > 0)
- No explicit cleanup mechanism
- Worker processes sometimes failed to terminate after last iteration

**After (v1.1.4)**:
- DataLoader always uses `num_workers = 0` for single-patient inference
- Try-finally block ensures cleanup even if exception occurs
- Explicit worker shutdown call added as safety measure

**Why This Works**:
- Single-patient inference processes one DICOM folder at a time
- No opportunity for parallel loading across patients
- Main-process loading eliminates worker management overhead
- No performance loss (multiprocessing wasn't beneficial in this scenario)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

1. **DICOM Format Requirements**:
   - Requires standard CT DICOM format with ImagePositionPatient tag
   - Slice thickness 4-6mm recommended (fallback available)

2. **Resource Requirements**:
   - GPU mode: Minimum 4GB VRAM recommended
   - CPU mode: 4GB+ RAM, processing time ~3-5 min/case

## üôè Acknowledgments

- **Issue Reporter**: User feedback on hanging behavior with 5-case pilot runs
- **Testing**: Validated on Linux + RTX 2060 environment
- **AI-CAC Project**: Original model and processing logic by Raffi Hagopian MD
